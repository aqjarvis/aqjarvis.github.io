            <p>I was born and raised in Sugarhouse, Utah. As an only child, I was was forced to become fiercely independent, or else I thought I would have died of boredum. I quickly became an avid reader, going on a new adventure with each novel I read. My parents are artists so I was surrounded by creativity in all manners of mediums. I believe this to be why I enjoy design so immensely.

                I've decided I'm destined to be a wanderer, always striving to see new things and learn new skills. Being in finance for as long as I have, I found myself unispired. I hope to get over the fear of failing at learning to code so that I can go on my next adventure.
